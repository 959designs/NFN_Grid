NFN_Grid
========

A simple flexible grid for responsive design

 -The baseline grids have a 20px gutter but you can adjust the math to suit your needs, preferably using a % instead of a fixed width.
 - Box-Sizing is set globally to adjust for any math deficiencies.
 - Just add your elements to each "module" and adjust as you go.
 - The Media Queries are set at the breakpoints that I normally use, but can easily be adjusted to suit your needs.
