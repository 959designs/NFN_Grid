NFN_Grid
========
A simple flexible grid for responsive web design.  There are no limits as long as you can use a calculator.  Enjoy!

Basic Info and guides
---------------------
1. The baseline grids have a 20px gutter but you can adjust the math to suit your needs, preferably using a % instead of a fixed width. Make sure to subtract your gutter %'s from the box- width %'s
2. Box-Sizing is set globally to adjust for any math deficiencies.
3. Just add your elements to each "module" and adjust as you go.
4. The Media Queries are set at the breakpoints that I normally use, but can easily be adjusted to suit your needs.
5. I use single line CSS formatting, so I apologize if you do not.  This will be changed to LESS in a future push which should make it easier for everyone.
